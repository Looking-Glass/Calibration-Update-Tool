## How to use
Make sure only one Looking Glass is plugged in (one HDMI and one USB connection) at a time, and run the executable. 

If you get a "Windows protected your PC" message, click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyway"

*Windows only for now, as multiplexing doesn't work on Mac and that is the only feature in the current update*

## Changelog
- 1.0.0:\
Updates firmware to add multiplexing support
